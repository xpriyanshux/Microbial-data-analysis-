# Microbial-data-analysis

This repository contains a collection of Bash scripts developed for performing QIIME2-based analysis on gut-microbial data. The scripts automate various stages of the analysis pipeline, including data acquisition, quality control, sequence processing, and taxonomic classification.

## Project Overview

The aim of this project is to provide a streamlined and automated approach to analyzing microbial community data using QIIME2, focusing on the gut microbiome. The scripts included in this repository facilitate the following key tasks:

- **Data Download:** Automated downloading of datasets using `wget`, with options to make the datasets executable.
- **Quality Control:** Execution of FastQC and MultiQC for assessing the quality of raw sequence data.
- **Sequence Counting:** Generation of CSV files that count the number of sequences per sample in FASTQ format.
- **Sample Filtering:** Removal of low-quality samples based on sequence count thresholds.
- **Sequence Processing:** Execution of `fastp` for processing and quality filtering of sequence data.
- **QIIME2 Analysis:** A series of QIIME2 commands for importing data, conducting sequence quality control, generating feature tables, performing taxonomic classification, and visualizing results.

## Features

- **Bash Automation:** Scripts are designed to automate repetitive tasks, reducing the potential for errors and saving time.
- **Comprehensive Workflow:** Covers all major steps from raw data acquisition to taxonomic analysis and visualization.
- **Customizable:** Parameters and file paths can be easily adjusted to fit specific datasets or research needs.

## Installation

To use these scripts, ensure that the following tools are installed and properly configured on your system:

- **Bash**: The scripts are written in Bash and should be executed in a Unix-like environment.
- **FastQC**: For quality control of raw sequences.
- **MultiQC**: For aggregating results from FastQC and other tools.
- **fastp**: For fast and accurate sequence preprocessing.
- **QIIME2**: For comprehensive microbiome analysis.

Installation commands for these tools are provided in the respective script comments.

## Usage

1. Download the dataset** using the provided script, and ensure it is executable.
2. Run quality control** checks on the raw sequence files using FastQC and MultiQC.
3. Count sequences** per sample and filter out low-quality samples.
4. Process the sequences** with `fastp` to ensure high-quality data.
5. Execute the QIIME2 commands** to perform taxonomic analysis and generate visualizations.

Each script is designed to be run independently, allowing you to tailor the workflow to your specific needs.
